       <div class = "rebeccaCollage">
        <h4> Collage Artist Badge</h4>
          <p> Rebecca led the Collage Artist badge this year. In the badge, girls learned how collages can be used to tell a story or emotion. At the end, all members of Troop 94881 came together to make two collages each. One collage was a study of color, and the other was a freestyle piece. Girls were encouraged to share their work with others. Needless to say, they all did a fantastic job! </p>

  <h4> Behind The Ballot </h4>
    <p> Behind the ballot was run by Sienna this year. This badge was to teach the ins and outs of voting and how to properly prepare when we reach the voting age. We all worked together on a slideshow to learn about local elections, state elections, and presidential elections. At the end we discussed campaign advertisments and had an opportunity to make our own individually! </p>
